# Spirograph
 
 One of the 'proper' things (I say that everytime) I made and the first thing I was proud of.
 Made prior to learning git/react/ES6/any type of practices.
 
 File last modified says it was made in September 2019.
 
 Absolutely not refactoring it, it's perfect already.
 (deleting and appending 200 items to the DOM every time a slider moves? sure)
 (move the sliders with resources open and watch your CPU usage go to space)
 (100 line function? Yeah sure, btw what does SRP stand for?)
 
 As an aside, some of the animations are quite interesting ('yarn' in particular).
 It generates an individual custom keyframe animation for every single circle.
 Obviously not the most efficient way but it does produce some weird effects.
