# Spirograph
 
 One of the 'proper' things (I say that everytime) I made and the first thing I was proud of.<br>
 Made prior to learning git/react/ES6/any type of practices.<br>
 
 File last modified says it was made in September 2019.<br>
 
 Absolutely not refactoring it, it's perfect already.<br>
 (deleting and appending 200 items to the DOM every time a slider moves? sure)<br>
 Move the sliders with resources open and watch your CPU usage go to space<br>
 (100 line function? Yeah sure, btw what does SRP stand for?)<br>
 
 As an aside, some of the animations are quite interesting ('yarn' in particular).<br>
 It generates an individual custom keyframe animation for every single circle.<br>
 Obviously not the most efficient way but it does produce some weird effects.<br>
